personal website project
this personal website was tailor-made to run on very low memory(just less than 100M) and cpu footprintt of VPS. Also i am trying to use all kinds of open sourced techonologies and programming lauguages (including, node.js, python, super lightweight web server, jQuery, bootstrap, sqlite) and demostrates how they can work together. 
You can also learn how different programming language can interoperate with each other.
