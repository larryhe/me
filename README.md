personal website project
<br>
this personal website was tailor-made to run on very low memory(just less than 100M) and cpu footprint of VPS. <br>
Also i am trying to use all kinds of open sourced techonologies and programming lauguages (including, node.js, python, super lightweight web server, jQuery, bootstrap, sqlite) and demostrates how they can work together. 
<br>You can also learn how different programming language can interoperate with each other.
